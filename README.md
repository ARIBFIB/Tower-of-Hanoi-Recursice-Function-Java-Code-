> **Solve the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle using recursion in Java**

## üóº About the Tower of Hanoi

The Tower of Hanoi is a classic mathematical puzzle that consists of three poles and a number of disks of different sizes, which can slide onto any pole. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack of disks from the initial pole to another pole, obeying the following rules:

- Only one disk can be moved at a time.
- Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or an empty pole.
- No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

## üéÆ The Challenge

In this project, you'll find a recursive Java implementation of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. The goal is to create a game challenge that tests the player's problem-solving skills and understanding of recursive algorithms.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- Recursive solution for the Tower of Hanoi puzzle
- Customizable number of disks
- Visual representation of the puzzle state
- Step-by-step solution display

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tower-of-hanoi.git](https://github.com/ARIBFIB/Tower-of-Hanoi-Recursice-Function-Java-Code-.git
   ```
2. Compile and run the `TowerOfHanoi` class:
   ```
   cd tower-of-hanoi
   javac TowerOfHanoi.java
   java TowerOfHanoi
   ```
